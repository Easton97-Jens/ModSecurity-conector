# NGINX with-crs/with-mrts HTTP-500 Cluster Analysis

## Summary

- Verified run id: `2026-06-16T19-12-00Z-614c8049`
- Job: `nginx:with-crs:with-mrts`
- Primary blocker: `none`
- HTTP-500 failures: `0`
- Likely cause: Historical evidence: NGINX worker could not traverse /root-owned runtime parents, generated docroot was inaccessible, and try_files /index.html looped into HTTP 500. New runs should block in the worker-docroot preflight before this becomes runtime mismatch evidence.
- Classification: `harness_environment_error`; secondary `nginx_config_error`
- Confidence: `high`

## Cluster Counts

| Group | Count | Classification | Representative Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Missing/Empty | - | - | - |

## Error Patterns

| Error Pattern | Count | Example | Affected Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Missing/Empty | - | - | - |

## Representative Cases

| Case | Expected | Actual | Access | Error Pattern | Classification | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Missing/Empty | - | - | - | - | - | - |

## Root Cause Evidence

- 0 HTTP-500 rows have 'rewrite or internal redirection cycle while internally redirecting to "/index.html"'.
- 0 HTTP-500 rows have htdocs/index.html Permission denied in final-run error logs.
- Historical namei evidence shows /root is 0700 while NGINX worker user is nobody; generated files below it are otherwise readable.
- No segfault/core/module-load error pattern was observed in the final-run cluster.

## Minimal Repro

- Minimal case: `mrts_100000_mrts_002_args_a_get_100000_1`
- Existing producer reproducer: `VERIFIED_RUN_FULL_MATRIX_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=3600 make verified-full-matrix-job CONNECTOR=nginx CRS=with-crs MRTS=with-mrts`
- Target to add: `make verified-nginx-mrts-case CASE=mrts_100000_mrts_002_args_a_get_100000_1 CRS=with-crs MRTS=with-mrts`
- Notes: The connector harness supports TEST_CASE internally, but the verified full-matrix path does not yet expose a single-case target with CRS/MRTS setup and isolated job metadata.

## Fix Plan

| Fix | File/Path | Risk | Expected Effect | Needs New Verified Run |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Keep verified NGINX Full-Matrix harness roots under VERIFIED_RUN_ROOT/NGINX_HARNESS_PARENT outside /root. | ci/run-full-matrix-parallel.sh / Makefile NGINX_HARNESS_PARENT | medium | Eliminates docroot Permission denied or reports it as a BLOCKED preflight before the 500 cluster can form. | True |
| Add a readiness/permission preflight that blocks NGINX jobs when worker user cannot traverse DOCROOT parents. | connectors/nginx/harness/run_nginx_smoke.sh | low | Classifies future inaccessible-docroot evidence as BLOCKED instead of runtime FAIL. | True |
| Add a verified single-case Full-Matrix target for NGINX with CRS/MRTS setup and job metadata. | Makefile / ci/run-full-matrix-job.py | low | Provides minimal repro without rerunning the 524-case NGINX job. | False |
